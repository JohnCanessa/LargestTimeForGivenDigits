# LargestTimeForGivenDigits
LeetCode 949. Largest Time for Given Digits in Java
https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-time-for-given-digits/

In this problem we are given an array of four integers.
Our mission, should we choose/decide to accept it, is
to find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using 
each digit exactly once.

If interested in my approach and comments, I invite you
to read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to
read and experiment, and repeat. Practice makes perfect.
The problem is that we do not know how many times we
should repeat ;o)

Enjoy;
